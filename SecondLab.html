<h1>My Plans for Today</h1>
<h3><em>Last updated: January 27, 2021.</em></h3>

<p>
    Hello! I am currently sitting down in bed typing on my Apple Macbook Pro.
    I have decided to update you with my plans for today (which is not much).
    For starters, let's just begin with my morning. I woke up around 8:30 AM
    today because I am crate-training my dog; I walked him, fed him, gave him
    water, then came straight home. I didn't do much afterwards, other than go
    over my finances, plan my events, and start editing/entering my tax info.
    As of right now, I am in class doing a lab assignment and I would say it is
    going pretty well since I have a good professor. After this, I am going to
    go to work to do my closing shift at Panera Bread, LLC as a Team Manager.
